# AI and Machine Learning for Coders

Laurence Moroney offers a great introduction to AI and Machine Learning from a programming point of view.

## Why am I exploring AI

This are my first steps into the computer science field of AI and I am having a hands on approach to it. Following the book I learn to code a model, I train the model and then I use the model to get predictions over unseen data.

The book guides you from building a Hello World! 1 neuron neural network to Speech or Computer Vision complex neural networks.

My main interest in the field is to get to solve problems that conventional programming can't solve.

## The book

So far the book is a great tool to have a friendly approach to AI when you are a programmer. I recommend it to anyone interested in AI but not interested in following a traditional PhD path to ML.
